# Introduction

Welcome to FINA 4380 for Fall 2022!

## Website

I will maintain all our notebooks on this website because Canvas does not render notebooks.
You can use this website to view our notebooks without downloading them and opening them in JupyterLab.
You can also download our notebooks by clicking the down arrow in the upper-right corner of every notebook page.
We will walk through these notebooks in class, adding notes and examples, and I will update these notebooks and this website after class.
I will maintain *everything else* (e.g., syllabus, project assignments, and grades) on our Canvas website.

The McKinney section has one notebook per chapter we will cover in {cite:t}`mckinney2018python`.
Likewise, the Lewinson section has one notebook per chapter we will cover in {cite:t}`lewinson2020python`.
As the semester progresses, I will add a Herron section with *ad hoc* notebooks from class discussions and a project section with template notebooks.

## GitHub Repository

The following GitHub repository generates this website: <https://github.com/richard-herron/fina-4380-2022-fall>.
If GitHub intimidates you, you can ignore this repository and download our notebooks one by one, as I describe above.
If GitHub does not intimidate you, you can use this repository in a few ways:

1. Bulk download all our notebooks to your laptop by cloning the repository or downloading a ZIP
1. Bulk upload all our notebooks to DataCamp Workspace (<https://app.datacamp.com/workspace/dashboard>) using its git integration
1. Bulk upload all our notebooks to Devspaces (<https://eyk.devspaces.com/>) using its git integration

I suggest you back up your files frequently if you use JupyterLab in the cloud.
If Python and GitHub are new to you, your best option is to install the Anaconda distribution of Python on your laptop and download notebooks as I describe above.
